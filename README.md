# DORE-DORE-Cloning
It is a clone coding project for the official website of [DORÉ DORÉ](http://doredore.co.kr/) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This was a free topic (with only one condition that it should include a one-page scroll function) assignment for the 2017-2 semester advanced multimedia production class. 
<br/>Since it was produced in a one-page scrolling navigation format, attaching [this video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52367973/116245424-e9443000-a7a3-11eb-9e78-c7aebff7702e.mp4) showing the process of its operation.
