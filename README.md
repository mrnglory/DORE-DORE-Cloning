# DORE-DORE-Cloning
It is a clone coding project for the official website of [DORÉ DORÉ](http://doredore.co.kr/) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This was a free topic (with only one condition that it should include a one-page scroll function) assignment for the 2017-2 semester advanced multimedia production class.
